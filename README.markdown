# select.css

A stupid, little class for styling selects without thinking too much.


## Prior art

I borrowed techniques from [wtfforms](http://wtfforms.com/),
[mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/),
and [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

It's been 2 years now. So they could have totally moved on.

## Install

#### NPM

`npm install select.css@0.0.1`

#### Script tag

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/select.css@0.0.1" />`

## Use

```html
<select class="select">
  ...  
</select>
```
